The licensing process often involves multiple case workers handling different parts. This delays the process, makes errors more likely, and means each worker only has part of the story about a family.

Assign a single case worker to handle the entire licensing process for each family. This gives families one consistent contact person and helps the worker understand the family better.

## How to do this

**Keep caseloads small.** A dedicated licensor will only work well if each worker handles no more than two to three families at a time. Review your current team and find ways to give some workers broader responsibilities in exchange for smaller caseloads.

**Consider restructuring specialized roles.** If you have workers who only do one part of licensing, train them to handle more parts of the process. This takes planning and cross-training.

**Start with a pilot program.** Try this with one or two workers who are interested in being dedicated licensors. Survey the families they work with and compare satisfaction, completion rates, and timing with families who work with multiple staff members.

**Continue to provide clerical support.** Even dedicated licensors need administrative help with paperwork and scheduling.

## This strategy in action
