Traditional foster care payments often don't cover the full costs of meeting children's needs, especially those with complex needs. Many children in institutions could be thriving in family settings, but income requirements prevent caregivers from providing the full-time care some children need.

Create new payment structures that encourage placement stability and enable full-time caregiving for high-need children and youth.

## How to do this

### Offer placement stability bonuses

Create a bonus structure that recognizes caregivers who maintain stable placements for children and youth in their care. Decide on amounts, milestones, and eligibility requirements that encourage stable placements and quality care for children and youth. Pay bonuses in cash equivalents, not gift cards to specific stores.

### Develop professional foster parent programs

Create pilot programs where foster parents receive salaries to provide full-time care for youth with high levels of need. Identify payment rates and expectations, such as not being able to disrupt placements for a set period like six months. Waive income requirements for professional foster parents since caregiving becomes their primary job.

Provide support services at all hours to help families maintain placements. Contact other agencies with existing professional foster parent programs to learn what works and adapt their approaches.

## This strategy in action

**Washington, DC** pays an annual stipend of $1200 if a child has been with a caregiver for 12 consecutive months, and operates two professional programs: PPY (Pregnant and Parenting Youth) and SOAR (Stabilize Observe Assess and Respite) for high-need children and youth. They pay an annual salary plus health insurance stipends and have achieved a 95% placement stability rate.

**California** has a successful professional foster parent program through Uplift Human Services.

**Utah** has proctor families for children with higher levels of need who receive additional training and supports.
